1. operator overloading formation: returnType operator operatorsymbol(formal parameter list) like:
   bool operator=(const int & a)
2. tips of overloading: 
   (1) don't change the priority of operator
   (2) don't change the associativity(结合律) of operator
   (3) can't use default parameter 
   (4) can't change the number of parameter that the operator need
   (5) can't overloading new operator like: "." ,".*", "::", "?:", "sizeof".
   (6) can't change the original rules of the operator.
   (7) operator can be overloading both in costumer define data type or inside-build data type.
3. "this" pointer: each object have "this" pointer, it is used when member function call object.
