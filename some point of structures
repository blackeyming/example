1. struct{} only define type of variables, no defination of any valiables.and no memory distribution either. but after a concrete
valiable is defined, thing change to the opposite.
2. we know that array is not allowed to be return in function, it only can serve as reference parameter in function. however,
struct can be both value parameter and reference parameter, also be returned by function.
3. remember that struct valiable can be assigned by another struct valiable.
4. and we can assign value to array through struct due to 3.
5. struct is no diffence with class except that it is public valiable in struct while private in class when in defaut.
what class can is what struct can.
